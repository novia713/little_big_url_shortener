# Integrating Whoops with Silex

**whoops** comes packaged with a Silex Service Provider: `Whoops\Provider\Silex\WhoopsServiceProvider`. Using it
in your existing Silex project is easy:

```php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Silex\Application;

// ... some awesome code here ...

if ($app['debug']) {
    $app->register(new Whoops\Provider\Silex\WhoopsServiceProvider());
}

// ...

$app->run();
```

And that's about it. By default, you'll get the pretty error pages if something goes awry in your development
environment, but you also have full access to the **whoops** library, obviously. For example, adding a new handler
into your app is as simple as extending `whoops`:

```php
$app['whoops'] = $app->extend('whoops', function ($whoops) {
    $whoops->pushHandler(new DeleteWholeProjectHandler());
    return $whoops;
});
```
